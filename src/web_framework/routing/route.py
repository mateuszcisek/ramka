class Route:
    """Route representation.

    A single route defines a path (e.g. `/users/`) and a view (e.g. UserView).

    The path should always be absolute which means it should start with a forward slash.
    It can consist of multiple arguments (e.g. `/users/{id}/`) and needs to be unique.

    The view can be either a class (that inherits from `web_framework.views.BaseView`)
    or a function that accepts two arguments: the request and the response. For
    function-based views, additional argument with all supported methods can be
    specified. By default, each view only supports GET requests. For class-based views,
    the view can have multiple methods (e.g. get, post, put, delete, etc.) and the
    handler will be selected based on the request method.

    Each argument can have a type specified. For example, path `/users/{id:d}/` means
    that the argument `id` should be a decimal number. For full list of supported types
    see https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse#format-specification.

    Fields:
        path (str): The path.
        view (Union[BaseView, Callable]): The view that will handle the path.
